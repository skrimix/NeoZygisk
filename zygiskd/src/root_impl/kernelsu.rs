// src/root_impl/kernelsu.rs

//! Detection and interaction logic for the KernelSU root solution.
//!
//! This module provides a unified API to interface with KernelSU, abstracting away the
//! underlying communication details. It is designed with backwards compatibility in mind,
//! supporting both the modern `ioctl` interface and the legacy `prctl` interface.
//!
//! The core design revolves around a one-shot detection mechanism. On the first call to
//! any function in this module, `detect_version`'s initialization logic runs once.
//! It first attempts to connect using the modern `ioctl` method. If that fails, it falls
//! back to the legacy `prctl` method. The result of this detection—including the determined
//! communication method and version status—is cached globally for the lifetime of the process.
//! All subsequent calls are then dispatched to the correct implementation instantly,
//! avoiding any repeated detection overhead.

/*
 * --- How to Calculate IOCTL Command Numbers ---
 * The ioctl command number is a 32-bit integer encoded with information about the
 * direction of data transfer, a magic 'type' character, and a sequence number. The size
 * field is deliberately set to 0 by KernelSU's driver, bypassing the kernel's size check.
 *
 * The formula, from `<asm-generic/ioctl.h>`, is:
 *   (((dir) << 30) | ((type) << 8) | (nr) | ((size) << 16))
 *
 * - dir: Data direction (_IOC_NONE=0, _IOC_WRITE=1, _IOC_READ=2).
 * - type: An 8-bit magic number. For KernelSU, this is 'K' (ASCII 75).
 * - nr: The 8-bit command sequence number.
 * - size: The size of the argument. KernelSU explicitly uses 0.
 *
 * Example Calculation for KSU_IOCTL_GET_INFO:
 * - C Definition: _IOC(_IOC_READ, 'K', 2, 0)
 * - dir=2, type='K'=75, nr=2, size=0
 * - Value = (2 << 30) | (75 << 8) | 2 = 0x80004B02
